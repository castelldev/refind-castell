# Set the name of a subdirectory in which icons are stored. Icons must
# have the same names they have in the standard directory. The directory
# name is specified relative to the main rEFInd binary's directory. If
# an icon can't be found in the specified directory, an attempt is made
# to load it from the default directory; thus, you can replace just some
# icons in your own directory and rely on the default for others.
# Default is "icons".

# Icon sizes. All icons are square, so just one value is specified. The
# big icons are used for OS selectors in the first row and the small
# icons are used for tools on the second row. Drive-type badges are 1/4
# the size of the big icons. Legal values are 32 and above. If the icon
# files do not hold icons of the proper size, the icons are scaled to
# the specified size. The default values are 48 and 128 for small and
# big icons, respectively.
#
small_icon_size 50
big_icon_size 128

# Custom images for the selection background. There is a big one (144 x 144)
# for the OS icons, and a small one (64 x 64) for the function icons in the
# second row. If only a small image is given, that one is also used for
# the big icons by stretching it in the middle. If only a big one is given,
# the built-in default will be used for the small icons.
#
# Like the banner option above, these options take a filename of an
# uncompressed BMP image file with a color depth of 24, 8, 4, or 1 bits,
# or a PNG image. The PNG format is required if you need transparency
# support (to let you "see through" to a full-screen banner).

# Which non-bootloader tools to show on the tools line, and in what
# order to display them:
#  shell           - the EFI shell (requires external program; see rEFInd
#                    documentation for details)
#  gptsync         - the (dangerous) gptsync.efi utility (requires external
#                    program; see rEFInd documentation for details)
#  apple_recovery  - boots the Apple Recovery HD partition, if present
#  mok_tool        - makes available the Machine Owner Key (MOK) maintenance
#                    tool, MokManager.efi, used on Secure Boot systems
#  about           - an "about this program" option
#  exit            - a tag to exit from rEFInd
#  shutdown        - shuts down the computer (a bug causes this to reboot
#                    EFI systems)
#  reboot          - a tag to reboot the computer
#  firmware        - a tag to reboot the computer into the firmware's
#                    user interface (ignored on older computers)
# Default is shell,apple_recovery,mok_tool,about,shutdown,reboot,firmware
